driver.pl output (** after fixing, see below **):

	Score = 52/60 [26/30 Corr + 26/30 Perf] (87 total operators)

Comments:

-Your submitted puzzles.c file does not compile due to not following some blc rules (which you can see either by running the driver or by running blc directly).  I had to comment out byteExtract and byteSwitch to run your code.

-Both these puzzle solutions also use multiplication (*), which is a prohibited operation.  Use shifting instead (multiply by a power of 2).

-Your solutions are almost completely unindented, which makes them much harder to read.  Be 100% strict with program indentation (even with short programs like this).

Score: 85/100
